Based on https://sourceforge.net/p/sc68/code/HEAD/tree r599 version (2015-09-13)

(Since I think this is the best version for emul effect through my test)

Changes I made:

1. Move configuration from right-click menu to Preferences->Playback->Decoding->SC68 and fixed the issue that the change in config can't be applied at meanwhile.

2. Added seeking function. Now you can drag the playback progress bar!
